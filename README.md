## Questions

### What is Package lock json?
The goal of package-lock. json file is to keep track of the exact version of every package that is installed so that a product is 100% reproducible in the same way even if packages are updated by their maintainers.
package-lock. json is **automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json.** It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates

### NGX
ngx = Angular + x (redefined/modern/new/next-gen) update like ngx-bootstrap
Also, many ng packages are running from the old AngularJS (i.e. 1.x) era. ngx packages are designed mostly post that time for Angular 2+.

### NGRX
**Reactive State for Angular(Angular Reactive Extensions)** = NgRx is a framework for building reactive applications in Angular. NgRx is inspired by the Redux pattern - unifying the events in your application and deriving state using RxJS. At a high level, NgRx stores a single state and uses actions to express state changes.
### How does callback function work?
A callback function is a **function passed into another function as an argument**, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. The above example is a synchronous callback, as it is executed immediately.
### Promise vs Callback function
Conclusion. To implement asynchronous code in JavaScript we use callback functions and promises. **A callback function is passed as an argument to another function whereas Promise is something that is achieved or completed in the future.**
### Promise
**The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value**
### Microservices vs. APIs
Microservices is an approach to building an application that **breaks its functionality into modular components.** APIs are part of an application that **communicates with other applications.** So, APIs can be used to enable microservices. As a result, you can make it easier to create software.
