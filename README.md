## Questions

### What is Package lock json?
The goal of package-lock. json file is to keep track of the exact version of every package that is installed so that a product is 100% reproducible in the same way even if packages are updated by their maintainers.

### NGX

### How does callback function work?
A callback function is a **function passed into another function as an argument**, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. The above example is a synchronous callback, as it is executed immediately.
### Promise vs Callback function
Conclusion. To implement asynchronous code in JavaScript we use callback functions and promises. **A callback function is passed as an argument to another function whereas Promise is something that is achieved or completed in the future.**
### Promise
**The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value**
